Historic Oregon News theme
===

This repository holds the theme and other customizations for http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu using Open ONI.


Usage
---

Don't use this directly!  Grab the [ONI Wrapper](https://github.com/uoregon-libraries/oni-wrapper)
repository and use its bash scripts (or reverse-engineer them if you can't run
bash scripts) to set up the theme and necessary plugins.
