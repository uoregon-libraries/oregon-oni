# Historic Oregon News theme

This repository holds the theme and other customizations for
https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu using Open ONI.

## Usage

Don't use this directly! Grab the [ONI Wrapper][1] repository and use its bash
scripts (or reverse-engineer them if you can't run bash scripts) to set up the
theme and necessary plugins.
